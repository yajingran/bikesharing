## Election-Audit Summary
This script shows vote counts distribution to the candiates and also the place they are collected from. However, this information can also be converted to other uses with some modifications. For example, it can be added with participation rate in each county to generate a big idea on the actual support rate for each candidate. It can also be modified to show more precise information on the number of votes a candidate received from each county. It can help the candidate when they are preparing for the election. For example, they can focus running campaigns in the county with lower vote percentage. However, lower vote counts and percentage do not really mean the participation rate is low in the county. Information such as total population and the number of people that vote will give more accurate and reliable insights in the election results.
